# 📂 Projects

## Project 2: Card Games Collection

**Description**:  
Developed a C# console application offering multiple card games (Higher or Lower, Same or Different, Highest Match).  
Each game uses a shared Deck and Player system, emphasizing modular design.

**Technical Details**:
- Language: C#
- Concepts: Interfaces (`IGame`), Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Polymorphism
- Unique Solutions:
  - Built a reusable `Deck` and `Card` system.
  - Implemented multiple card games from the same base code.
  - Menu system lets users choose which game to play dynamically.

## Project 3: Word Guessing Game (Ordle Clone)

**Description**:  
Built a Word Guessing Game using WPF and C#.  
The user must guess a secret five-letter word, receiving feedback after each guess showing correct letters and placement.

**Technical Details**:
- Language: C#
- Framework: WPF (.NET 8.0)
- Concepts: Event-driven programming, GUI Development, File I/O
- Unique Solutions:
  - Dynamic word bank loaded from external text files.
  - Clear separation of game logic (`GameEngine.cs`) and UI (`MainWindow.xaml`).
